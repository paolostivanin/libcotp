## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it **privately** via [e-mail](mailto:paolostivanin@users.noreply.github.com).  
The process is as follows:
- Send me an e-mail describing the security issue.
- Within **24 hours**, I will acknowledge your report and provide initial feedback (for example, whether it is indeed a vulnerability and its potential severity).
- Within **7 days**, I will work on a fix and release an update.
- Once the update is available, I will publish a [security advisory](https://github.com/paolostivanin/OTPClient/security/advisories).  

## Recent Hardening
